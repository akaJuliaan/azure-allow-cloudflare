This [Azure Automation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/overview) script creates two rules in your nsg to allow Cloudflare's IPs to access the ports `80 and 443`. This is very useful if you only want to allow access to your website through your domain which is managed by Cloudflare. You should combine this script with a schedule that the Cloudflare IPs always stay up to date.
